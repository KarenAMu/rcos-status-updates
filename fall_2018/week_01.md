## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Examples:
> Got shuttle tracker environmnet set up on my laptop and got it running and got familiar with the localhost:8080\admin page.
	For some reason can no longer access localhost:8080 page

## This Week's Plan


> Figure out issue behind why localhost:8080 was not working and work on parsing schedule data from the schedule excel sheet and become more familiar with that.

## Anything Blocking?

> Lack of git knowledge is preventing me from pulling code from the shuttle tracker master
