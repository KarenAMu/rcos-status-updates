## Last Week's Accomplishments

>  Finished writing convertTime function and pushed code to Github
>  can now run .sql on my machine
## This Week's Plan
>  send a pull request with rest of group

## Anything Blocking?

>  Finals

## Notes/What I did this Semester
> learned Go, Postgres, and how Github works
> wrote first attempt at a schedule parser that converted Xcel schedules into Json file, never got used since the format that I wrote it in was not the one Front-end could use
> really wished I could have contributed more this semester, but had many technical issues that prevented me from working (had to re setup shuttletracker on my machine several time, wouldn't be able to run postgres files for some reason. etc)
> excited since next semester I can skip the formalalities of setting up my machines and dive into coding
