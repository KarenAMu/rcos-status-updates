## Last Week's Accomplishments

>  Tried to run .sql file, updated a few packages in trying to get .sql to work
> finally can run shuttle tracker (updated version) locally
## This Week's Plan
>  get .sql file working so I can work on the time function
> create a pull request for time function once I get the files to properly run

## Anything Blocking?

>  Weird front-end issue(I think) or some sort of linker error preventing me from running .sql files
