What I did last week:
	Got shuttle tracker environmnet set up on my laptop and got it running and got familiar with the localhost:8080\admin page.
	For some reason can no longer access localhost:8080 page

What I will do this weel:
	Figure out issue behind why localhost:8080 was not working and work on parsing schedule data from the schedule excel sheet and become more familiar with that.

Any things blocking me:
	Nothing!
