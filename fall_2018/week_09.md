## Last Week's Accomplishments

>  Found website that will display time whenever refreshesed, however it is kind of buggy so maybe I should find another one
> Found a few ways to obtain time, either through API,through shuttle tracker's server (maybe), or through a webiste that displays it as a JSON file
## This Week's Plan
> Find one way to find time out of the three listed above
>  Implement function

## Anything Blocking?

>  Lack of knowledge in PostgreSQL
