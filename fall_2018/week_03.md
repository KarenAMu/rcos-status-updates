## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Examples:
>  Modified Nick's code on parsing Xcel files so that actually parses files now. Code also dumps data from Xcel sheet into JSON file.

## This Week's Plan


>  Work with other members on my team on how to better (less hard-code) parse xcel sheets and dump current JSON file into Postgres so Shuttle Tracker can actually use it.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing!
