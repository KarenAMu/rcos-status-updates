## Last Week's Accomplishments

>  Fixed constraints on buttons for iOS Settings page
>  Tried to connect to database called Firebase, created huge bug and now can't open any of my GroupRide files

## This Week's Plan


> Revert changes so Firebase won't prevent me from opening GroupRide files

## Anything Blocking?

>  Firebase messed up all my files - not able to open any GroupRide files
